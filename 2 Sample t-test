#A physician is evaluating a new diet for her patients with a family history of heart disease. To test the effectiveness of this diet, 16 patients are placed on the diet for 6 months. Their weights and triglyceride levels are measured before and after the study, and the physician wants to know if either set of measurements has changed. (Data set: dietstudy.csv)

import scipy.stats as stats
deit=pd.read_csv("dietstudy.csv")

stats.ttest_rel(a=deit.tg0,
               b=deit.tg4)
Ttest_relResult(statistic=1.2000008533342437, pvalue=0.24874946576903698)
From the above output pvalue=(24.8/2)%. so we will reject the alternate which tells that triglyceride levels has not changed due to deit.

stats.ttest_rel(a=deit.wgt0,
               b=deit.wgt4)
Ttest_relResult(statistic=11.174521688532522, pvalue=1.137689414996614e-08)

From the above output pvalue<5%. so we will not reject the alternate which tells that weight levels has decrease due to deit.
